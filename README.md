# OpenCV-face-detection
if the Rpi detects a face, get notified via a pushbulle push!

Code modifed from http://blog.oscarliang.net/raspberry-pi-face-recognition-opencv/

just a small project utilizing the Adafruit LCD plate for the Rpi and a webcam to notify me whenever anyone is in front of my raspberry pi.
